Conceptual Approach:

 > Technology used to build this project is C# WPF with MVVM pattern.
 
 > Layered Architecture and Introduced Interface to decouple the logic to make the code unit testable.
 

 
Cyclomatic Complexity : All the methods are below 15.we are good at here.



TODO Improvements:
 
  > Modulerization of class library can be done
 
  > Decouple the module using IOC (Inversion of Control) container for better saclable and unit testable.
 
  > using TPL(Task parallel library) for multi threaded application for better performance.
